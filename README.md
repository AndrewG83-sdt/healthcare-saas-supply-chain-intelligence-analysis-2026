# Intelligence Assessment – Healthcare SaaS Supply Chain Risk

This repository contains a structured intelligence assessment focused on systemic cyber risk in healthcare SaaS supply chains.

The objective is not technical exploitation analysis, but structured analytical reasoning applied to critical infrastructure resilience.

The assessment follows intelligence methodology principles:
- Key Judgments
- Confidence levels
- Alternative hypotheses
- Explicit limitations
- Strategic implications

All scenarios are modeled using publicly documented ransomware tradecraft patterns (2023–2025).
