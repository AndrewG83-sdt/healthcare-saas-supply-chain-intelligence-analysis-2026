# Executive Brief

## Overview

A healthcare SaaS provider hosting services for multiple regional clinics is compromised through a vulnerable third-party dependency.

The attacker inserts malicious code into a routine software update distributed to ~42 healthcare organizations.

Within 10 days:

- 17 organizations experience data exfiltration
- 8 suffer ransomware deployment
- Telemedicine services are disrupted
- Patient scheduling systems fail

## Why This Matters

The event demonstrates:

- Supply-chain amplification effect
- Centralized SaaS = centralized risk
- Healthcare digital dependency vulnerability

The systemic risk exceeds the technical breach itself.
