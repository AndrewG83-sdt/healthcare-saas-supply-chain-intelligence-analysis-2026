# Scope and Assumptions

## Scope

This study models a supply-chain compromise involving a Healthcare SaaS provider delivering:

- Electronic Health Record (EHR) services
- Appointment scheduling
- Telemedicine integration
- Cloud-hosted patient data

The scenario is based on documented tradecraft observed in:
- Human-operated ransomware groups
- Supply chain compromises
- Mass exploitation of SaaS platforms (2023–2025 trends)

This is a modeled intelligence exercise, not attribution to a specific real-world entity.

## Objective

To analyze:

- How a SaaS compromise can cascade into national healthcare disruption
- Tradecraft phases and detection gaps
- Systemic resilience weaknesses
